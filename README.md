A game called Freeze Tag.


Assignment
In this project, we will create a game called Freeze Tag.


Part 1:
Five rectangles start on the canvas at random locations. These rectangles have different widths and heights and different x and y velocities. They also have a random starting color. The width, height, and magnitude of the x and y velocities of each rectangle will not change during the game.
The rectangles move around the screen bouncing off the walls. Each time a rectangle bounces off a wall, its color changes to a new random color. The player uses the mouse to try to click on the rectangles. If the player successfully clicks on a rectangle, the rectangle will freeze and turn red. If the player can freeze all five rectangles, he or she wins.


Part 2:
In part two we will add a new feature to the game. When a moving rectangle collides with a frozen rectangle, the frozen rectangle will be unfrozen or, in other words, the frozen rectangle will start moving again. It should start moving with the same velocity (speed and direction) that it was moving before it stopped.
